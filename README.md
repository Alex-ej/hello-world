Starting tutorial for Github in order to succeed in writing my master thesis

In this code I have applied a few changes to the original file that was created automatically by Github beforehand.
I really need to learn this stuff in order to implement a website for my thesis project. I'm looking forward to learn a bunch of new technologies while proceeding with the project.
